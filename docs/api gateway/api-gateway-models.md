**API Gateway - Create Models**

_A model defines the structure of the incoming payload using JSON Schema. The model is an optional, but not required, piece of API Gateway. By providing a model, you make it easier to define the upcoming mapping template that actually does the transformation between the client and server._

1. In the API that we created, check for **Models** in the left. 
2. There will be some pre-existing Models, we'll create new ones.
3. Create the Model as below:
